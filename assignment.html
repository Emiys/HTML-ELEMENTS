    <h1>Adeleke Elhanan</h1>
    <p><strong>Welcome to my website</strong> I attend Top Rank Model College, my second home and the place where my
        star
        shines brightest. As a proud JSS3 Citrine
        student, I’m in a class that’s known for its lively energy (sometimes too lively, but that’s what makes it fun,
        right?
        😉). My school blends the British/Nigerian Cambridge curriculum, challenging me to excel in everything from
        Agric
        Science to ICT—subjects I’ve totally made my own.

        Top Rank Model College has been a stage for my incredible journey—whether it’s leading as Social Prefect,
        preparing for
        spelling bees, or taking part in exciting competitions. Teachers like Mr. Ubana (who I’ll always remember) and
        others
        have guided and inspired me along the way.

        Top Rank Model College isn’t just my school—it’s my launchpad for dreams, friendships, and the amazing future
        I’m
        building every day! 💛🏫✨
